## Completed

Renamed client directories and moved to `clients/`:

Updated all references in:
- `.github/workflows/*.yml`
- `utils/build.sh`
- `hooks/pre-commit`
- `release.py`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `.dockerignore`
- `.dev-ops/*.md`
- `.claude/commands/*.md`
- `docs/docs/development/*.md`
- `clients/*/package.json`, `README.md`, etc.
